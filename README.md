This is an example project (`rebar3`-based) for showcasing [Arizona](https://github.com/arizona-framework/arizona)'s
capabilities, always aiming at the tip of its `main` branch (which is why there's no CHANGELOG).

To run it, boot the Erlang/`rebar3` shell: e.g. `rebar3 shell`.

If no errors were shown, the application should now be served at `localhost:8080`.
